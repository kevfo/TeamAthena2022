# Team Athena's GitHub Repository

*PS: If you don't already have Git installed on your machine, you can install it here: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)*

First and foremost, welcome to team Athena's private GitHub repository for this
year's Biohackathon event (supported by the [National Kidney Foundation](https://nkfs.org/)
and ANATA [can't find their company website unfortunately]).

Like I mentioned in the group chat, this repository will contain *all* of our code
for this event - I chose to use Git because it's the easiest way to:

1.  **Do code reviews**

    A *code review* is the act of continuously and systematically working with
    your fellow developers to check for mistakes in their code (and also share
    any possible improvements).  

    Granted - this is a hackathon (and so code reviews need not be so stringent), but
    this event is still collaborative nonetheless.  Because of this,
    there are *still* some standards to be met (i.e., it won't do any of us good if one of us writes un-readable code)!

1.  **Share code**

    The other way we could do this is via WhatsApp - we could all send each other
    our script files, but then it'd be difficult to see changes, but also review them
    (i.e., if somebody makes a mistake coding something, then there's really no easy way
    of undoing a mistake without having to manually delete it yourself [which is dangerous
    if you're not careful]).

1.  **Perform version control**

    Humans aren't perfect - sometimes, we do things that we regret, and the same
    also applies to programming.  Sometimes, you write code that turns out to be
    not-so-great anymore and want to remove it (or worse yet, you've made some
    colossal screw-up while coding) - Git can help you restore your code with
    ease!

Like the third point implies, **Git** is a version control system: systems that
help track changes in code over time.  Granted - there are many version control
systems out there, but Git is one of the most, if not *the* most popular!

## Resources for Learning R

If you have little to no experience with R (whether it be because you've never touched
it before or because you've forgotten what you've learned in *BS0004: Introduction to Data Science*), here are
some resources to help you get up to speed (so that you don't feel *too* overwhelmed during the Biohackathon).  
Click on the bullet points to access these resources!

### Book(s)

If you are the reading-type, then you could check out this / these resource(s):

1.  [**Hands-On Programming with R**](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/basics.html#arguments)

    If you're pressed for time, then *at least* read through chapter two of this book.  This book is
    meant to be an introduction to R for non-programmers and is great if you just want to learn
    enough R to be productive in it.  

    While I don't expect you to read through each chapter of this book, you are certainly more than
    welcome to if you have the time / are interested!  However, there is no need to focus too much on
    chapter 10 (i.e., the S3 OOP system) if you are going to do this - we will not (hopefully) have to
    deal with this!

### MOOCs

If you prefer MOOCs to books (or just want a certificate), then you can consider taking the
following MOOCs for free (recall that all NTU students have free Coursera access to MOOCs from other institutions):

1.  [**R Programming**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming?specialization=jhu-data-science) *by Johns Hopkins University*

    This is a supposed-introduction to the R programming language (i.e., what is R, how do you define a function in R, etc).  Although this course is four-weeks long, it's still *very tough*!

1.  [**Practical Machine Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning) *by Johns Hopkins University*

    This course is actually part of a data science specialization by Johns Hopkins University, but it's still very much
    relevant to this event.  This course is four-weeks long and also *super* tough!

1.  [**Data Visualization in R with `ggplot2`**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/jhu-data-visualization-r) *by Johns Hopkins University*

    If you don't know (or forgot) what `ggplot2` is, it's a package in R that helps you to create presentation-worthy plots (i.e., if you are presenting your work in front of an audience, then `ggplot2` could be well worth considering).  

    Unlike the other two MOOCs, this one is relatively chill - although the course is also four weeks long, I managed to finish
    it in one sitting!
