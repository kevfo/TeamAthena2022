# Team Athena's GitHub Repository

*If you don't already have Git installed on your machine, you can install it here: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)*

First and foremost, welcome to team Athena's private GitHub repository for this
year's Biohackathon event (supported by the [National Kidney Foundation](https://nkfs.org/)
and ANATA [can't find their company website unfortunately]).

Like I mentioned in the group chat, this repository will contain *all* of our code
for this event - I chose to use Git because it's the easiest way to:

1.  **Do code reviews**

    A *code review* is the act of continuously and systematically working with
    your fellow developers to check for mistakes in their code (and also share
    any possible improvements).  

    Granted - this is a hackathon (and so code reviews need not be so stringent), but
    this event is still a collaboratory project nonetheless.  Because of this,
    there are *still* some standards to be met!

1.  **Share code**

    The other way we could do this is via WhatsApp - we could all send each other
    our script files, but then it'd be difficult to see changes, but also review them
    (i.e., if somebody makes a mistake coding something, then there's really no easy way
    of undoing a mistake without having to manually delete it yourself [which is dangerous
    if you're not careful]).

1.  **Perform version control**

    Humans aren't perfect - sometimes, we do things that we regret, and the same
    also applies to programming.  Sometimes, you write code that turns out to be
    not-so-great anymore and want to remove it (or worse yet, you've made some
    colossal screw-up while coding) - Git can help you restore your code with
    ease!

Like the third point implies, **Git** is a version control system: systems that
help track changes in code over time.  Granted - there are many version control
systems out there, but Git is one of the most, if not *the* most popular!
