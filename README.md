# Team Athena's GitHub Repository

*PS: If you don't already have Git installed on your machine, you can install it here: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)*

First and foremost, welcome to team Athena's private GitHub repository for this
year's Biohackathon event (supported by the [National Kidney Foundation](https://nkfs.org/)
and ANATA [can't find their company website unfortunately]).

Like I mentioned in the group chat, this repository will contain *all* of our code
for this event - I chose to use Git because it's the easiest way to:

1.  **Do code reviews**

    A *code review* is the act of continuously and systematically working with
    your fellow developers to check for mistakes in their code (and also share
    any possible improvements).  

    Granted - this is a hackathon (and so code reviews need not be so stringent), but
    this event is still collaborative nonetheless.  Because of this,
    there are *still* some standards to be met (i.e., it won't do any of us good if one of us writes un-readable code)!

1.  **Share code**

    The other way we could do this is via WhatsApp - we could all send each other
    our script files, but then it'd be difficult to see changes, but also review them
    (i.e., if somebody makes a mistake coding something, then there's really no easy way
    of undoing a mistake without having to manually delete it yourself [which is dangerous
    if you're not careful]).

1.  **Perform version control**

    Humans aren't perfect - sometimes, we do things that we regret, and the same
    also applies to programming.  Sometimes, you write code that turns out to be
    not-so-great anymore and want to remove it (or worse yet, you've made some
    colossal screw-up while coding) - Git can help you restore your code with
    ease!

Like the third point implies, **Git** is a version control system: systems that
help track changes in code over time.  Granted - there are many version control
systems out there, but Git is one of the most, if not *the* most popular!

## Code of Conduct

Before I begin listing any resources for (re-)learning R, I think it's best to lay down
some grounds rules first in the forms of questions that you might have.  This is so that we all know what to expect (and so that I don't end up nagging your ears off during the event).

### How long is the event during each day?

Technically, the event takes place from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM during each day of the Biohackathon.  However, if you want to or need to code before or after those hours, then by all means, go right ahead.  

However, I could care less about those hours truth be told.  As long as you get your share of work done in a reasonable amount of time, you could be in Sentosa enjoying a family outing during those hours and I wouldn't care.  After all - I trust that all of you are responsible enough to get things done without needing constant reminders (and also seek help if need be)!

### How would each day unfold?

That's tough to say - only we would know for certain during the event itself.  However, here's what I imagine would happen on a typical day:

1.  At the beginning of each day, we let each other know where we are in the workflow and the presentation.  
1.  We continue working throughout the day, also helping each other out if need be (this can continue past 5:00 PM if it's necessary).
1.  Once you are satisfied enough with your code, make a pull request to this repository and I'll have a look at it sometime in the evening.  Do make sure to comment on the changes that you've made in your pull requests - it saves time for all of us (i.e., so that myself and others know what it is that you've done)!

### What if I'm really stuck during the event?

If that's the case:

1.  You can ask for help in the group chat.  Perhaps somebody else might be able to solve the issue that you are having!
1.  Find help on the internet.

If you are genuinely stuck, then the onus is ultimately on you to get yourself un-stuck.  Whatever the case though, please do not just sit around and do nothing; four days is *not* a lot of time!

## Resources for Learning R

If you have little to no experience with R (whether it be because you've never touched
it before or because you've forgotten what you've learned in *BS0004: Introduction to Data Science*), here are
some resources to help you get up to speed (so that you don't feel *too* overwhelmed during the Biohackathon).  
Click on the bullet points to access these resources!

### Book(s)

If you are the reading-type, then you could check out this / these resource(s):

1.  [**Hands-On Programming with R**](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/basics.html#arguments)

    If you're pressed for time, then *at least* read through chapter two of this book.  This book is
    meant to be an introduction to R for non-programmers and is great if you just want to learn
    enough R to be productive in it.  

    While I don't expect you to read through each chapter of this book, you are certainly more than
    welcome to if you have the time / are interested!  However, there is no need to focus too much on
    chapter 10 (i.e., the S3 OOP system) if you are going to do this - we will not (hopefully) have to
    deal with this!

### MOOCs

If you prefer MOOCs to books (or just want a certificate), then you can consider taking the
following MOOCs for free (recall that all NTU students have free Coursera access to MOOCs from other institutions):

1.  [**R Programming**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming?specialization=jhu-data-science) *by Johns Hopkins University*

    This is a supposed-introduction to the R programming language (i.e., what is R, how do you define a function in R, etc).  Although this course is four-weeks long, it's still *very tough*!

1.  [**Practical Machine Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning) *by Johns Hopkins University*

    This course is actually part of a data science specialization by Johns Hopkins University, but it's still very much
    relevant to this event.  This course is four-weeks long and also *super* tough!

1.  [**Data Visualization in R with `ggplot2`**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/jhu-data-visualization-r) *by Johns Hopkins University*

    If you don't know (or forgot) what `ggplot2` is, it's a package in R that helps you to create presentation-worthy plots (i.e., if you are presenting your work in front of an audience, then `ggplot2` could be well worth considering).  

    Unlike the other two MOOCs, this one is relatively chill - although the course is also four weeks long, I managed to finish
    it in one sitting!
