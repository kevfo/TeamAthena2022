# Team Athena's Presentation-End Stuff

This folder contains all of team Athena's code for the presentation-end of
our analysis - namely, our web application (and other components if necessary).

R is not the best language for web development, but it is still doable nonetheless -
hence, I will list some resources that you can consult during the event itself:

1.  [**Mastering Shiny**](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html)

    This is a *very* nicely written book about Shiny.  Shiny is great in that
    it allows you to create web applications in R for displaying your work
    without having to know a single lick of HTML, CSS, and / or JavaScript (i.e.,
    languages that you must learn if you are to work in web development one day).  

1.  [**R Markdown Cookbook**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)

    Depending on what we choose to do in the end, some R Markdown knowledge could
    go a long way in benefiting our team.  R Markdown is a variant of the original
    *Markdown* language (a markup language for creating documents like this) that
    allows data scientists (and people like us) to present our work in a visually-appealing way!

1.  [**R Markdown: The Definitive Guide**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

    R Markdown can be used to create documents of all sorts - this book will show you how!

## Resources that We May or May Not Need

Like the title of this sub-section implies, this sub-section contains resources that
we may or may not end up using (based off several ideas I dreamed up over a sleepless night):

1.  [**A Quick Guide to LaTeX**](https://www.library.caltech.edu/sites/default/files/latex-quickguide.pdf)

    This is a document I found off Caltech's repository.  If we ever have a need to display mathematics, some LaTeX
    would definitely do us good (i.e., there's a very good reason why LaTeX is more or less the "gold" standard for
    typesetting mathematics in most professional literature) - not to mention that it can also be used to make
    visually-appealing PDF documents.

    This guide is a bit like boxed wine: it's not the nicest thing to look at or read, but it gets the job done well enough.

1.  [**flexdashboard**](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html)

    This is a package that allows you to create responsive and dynamic UI without having to write a single line of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript (in a sense, it's a bit like Shiny).  

1.  [**bookdown**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)

    This package allows you to create gitbook-style websites (great for documentations and whatnot) solely using R Markdown.
