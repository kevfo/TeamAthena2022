# Team Athena's Presentation-End Stuff

This folder contains all of team Athena's code for the presentation-end of
our analysis - namely, our web application (and other components if necessary).

R is not the best language for web development, but it is still doable nonetheless -
hence, I will list some resources that you can consult during the event itself:

1.  [**Mastering Shiny**](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html)

    This is a *very* nicely written book about Shiny.  Shiny is great in that
    it allows you to create web applications in R for displaying your work
    without having to know a single lick of HTML, CSS, and / or JavaScript (i.e.,
    languages that you must learn if you are to work in web development one day).  

1.  [**R Markdown Cookbook**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)

    Depending on what we choose to do in the end, some R Markdown knowledge would
    go a long way in benefiting our team.  R Markdown is a variant of the original
    *Markdown* language (a markup language for creating documents like this) that
    allows data scientists (and people like us) to present our work in a visually-appealing way!

1.  [**R Markdown: The Definitive Guide:**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

    R Markdown can be used to create documents of all sorts - this book will show you how!
